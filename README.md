#  Potato Leaf Disease Prediction 

## Overview

This project applies *deep learning* and *image analysis* to identify and classify potato leaf diseases, specifically *Late Blight* and *Early Blight*. A *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* is trained on an extensive dataset of labeled leaf images to automate disease detection. The system examines leaf *patterns, discoloration, and texture* to accurately classify the health condition of the plant. This AI-driven solution enhances precision in plant disease monitoring, reducing reliance on traditional manual inspections. The technology is adaptable to research applications, automated crop health surveillance, and early disease mitigation strategies.

## Features

- Image-based disease detection for potato leaves

- Deep learning model trained using CNN architecture

- Classification into healthy or diseased categories

- Web-based deployment using Streamlit for easy accessibility

##Usage

- 1. Upload a potato leaf image.

- 2. The model processes the image and classifies it as Healthy or Diseased.
